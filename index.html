                            Companies and brands have never been so visible and exposed. In order to exist in front of their audience, they produce and share massive amounts of content, on a variety of communication channels, with the risk that the image promoted by the brand is no longer in line with the image perceived by the audience, and that the slightest step out of line has a lasting impact on their reputation. The words and images they share must reflect their vision, their commitments and their values.
